# MERN_app-template
Boilerplate for full MERN stack apps

## Overview
Full stack template with alot of comments for help, ready for cloud deployment with built in CRUD functions and components.
Made so the file structure is easy to follow and replicate to keep order as app increases in size.
Comes with basic dependencies so developers can choose to add redux or other depencies on top off it. But allows for devs to have more choice on how the app is built.

**__Site is deployment ready out of the box__**

## How to use it
Get the zip file from the releases section and put the contents from it into your main project folder. Then on server.js level open the terminal and type *npm install* this will install backend dependencies it will auto switch to the client side and install it's dependencies.

Once dependencies are installed type *npm start* in the termial. This will start the server then auto switch to client and boot it. It will open up in a new tab in your default browser.

**Be sure to link DB with mlab or other extension for deployment**
